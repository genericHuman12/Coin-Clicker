This game is played by clicking the coin on the right hand side. Once you have clicked enough, you can then buy an upgrade. 
There are 2 upgrades you can get in this game. One type is an upgrade to the coin, which changes it into a quarter and 
gives you 25 cents per click instead of one. This is accesed by th button below the coin and costs 75 cents. The second
type of upgrade is called a bank, and you can buy multiple of them. Each one gives you 1 cent per second and the price 
rises the more you buy. These are accesed by the button that says "Bank". Thank you for playing and hope you have fun.

P.S. This is a bare bones version and is not very expansive. I might upgrade it over time in order to make it more
fulfilling and fun. In order to play, you need python and an editor, preferrably VS Code. All other files, including pygame, are included
